                <h2>Black Beans</h2>
                <p>These are native to South and Central America, so it’s no surprise that they’re the star of so many Latin and Caribbean dishes. They have a soft, tender texture and a creamy, mild flavor—like many beans, they take on the flavor of whatever they’re cooked with.</p>

                <h2>Kidney Bens</h2>
                <p>Native to Central America and Mexico, they’re mild and faintly sweet in flavor and cook up creamy and tender. You’ll find them in tons of chili recipes, as well as minestrone soup, pasta e fagioli and curries.</p>

                <h2>Edamame</h2>
                <p>Edamame (the delicious side we order at Japanese restaurants) is the young soybean, still green, and meant to be removed from the pod and popped into your mouth. The matured soybeans are what can be made into tofu, soybean paste, and much more! </p>

                <h2>Mung Beans</h2>
                <p>These tiny green beans are massively popular in East and Southeast Asia, as well as the Indian Subcontinent. They go by many names (green gram! maash! monggo!) and taste slightly sweet. </p>

                <h2>Peas</h2>
                <p>Peas are among the most popular beans (yes, they're beans) served in the U.S., but domesticated peas actually originated in the Mediterranean and Middle East. We like them most when they're at peak deliciousness in the spring, but we always have a bag of frozen peas on deck to use in soups, potpies, stews and more. </p>
